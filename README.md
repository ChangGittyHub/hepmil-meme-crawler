## 🔐 Setup

1. **Create Reddit App**  
Go to [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) and register a **script-type** app.

2. **Create Telegram Bot**  
Use [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) to create a bot and get your `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`.

3. **Environment Variables**  
Create a `.env` file:

```env
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=script:hepmil-meme-crawler:v1.0 (by /u/your_username)
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_bot_token
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User sends `/dailyreport` to the Telegram bot
2. Bot triggers `reddit_scraper.py` to fetch and store top 20 memes
3. Bot queries the latest data from `memes.db`
4. `reportlab` generates a PDF with meme content and upvote chart
5. Bot sends the report as a file to the user
